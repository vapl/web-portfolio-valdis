    NFTs Guard is an MVP security platform built to explore risk detection in NFT
    ecosystems. The project follows a Web2-first architecture that consumes and
    processes blockchain data, transforming raw on-chain activity into clear,
    actionable insights.

    The platform helps users identify suspicious patterns in wallets and NFT
    collections through a fast, intuitive dashboard designed for both technical
    and non-technical users.

    The project started with a simple idea: make on-chain risk signals easier to
    understand for everyday NFT users. What initially seemed like a relatively
    small product quickly revealed the complexity behind blockchain data,
    performance constraints, and usability challenges.

    From early research and wireframing to interaction design and implementation,
    the project evolved through continuous iteration, trade-offs, and technical
    decisions aimed at keeping the MVP focused and realistic.

<Section id="problem" title="Problem">
  NFT markets are highly exposed to manipulation patterns such as rug pulls,
  wash trading, and whale-driven price movements. While blockchain data is
  transparent, identifying these patterns requires technical knowledge and
  manual investigation.

<Section id="scope" title="Scope & Responsibilities">
  NFTs Guard was developed as a solo project, covering the entire product
  lifecycle from concept definition to a production-ready MVP.

  <ul>
    <li>- Defining the product concept and MVP scope</li>
    <li>- UX/UI and interaction design</li>
    <li>- Frontend development using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS</li>
    <li>- Backend logic and database design with Supabase and PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>- Integrating Ethereum blockchain data as an external data source</li>
    <li>- Designing heuristic-based risk detection and scoring logic</li>
    <li>- Performance optimization and system stability</li>
  </ul>
</Section>

<Section id="challenges" title="Technical Challenges">
  One of the main challenges was working with raw blockchain data in a traditional
  Web2 architecture. While the data is public, it is noisy, inconsistent, and not
  designed for direct user consumption.

  <ul>
    <li>- Normalizing and interpreting noisy on-chain data</li>
    <li>- Designing a readable risk score for non-technical users</li>
    <li>- Maintaining low latency while relying on external data sources</li>
    <li>- Avoiding tight coupling between blockchain logic and UI components</li>
  </ul>
</Section>

<Section id="decisions" title="MVP Decisions & Trade-offs">
  To keep the project focused and achievable, several conscious trade-offs were
  made during development. Rather than building decentralized execution logic,
  the platform treats blockchain strictly as a data layer.

  <ul>
    <li>- Web2-first architecture with blockchain as a data source</li>
    <li>- Ethereum-only support for faster validation</li>
    <li>- Heuristic-based risk flags instead of ML-heavy solutions</li>
    <li>- Scalable architecture without premature complexity</li>
  </ul>

<Section id="outcome" title="Outcome">
  NFTs Guard demonstrates the ability to design and deliver a
  production-oriented Web2 application that leverages blockchain data without
  unnecessary complexity. The project highlights end-to-end ownership, pragmatic
  decision-making, and a strong focus on usability and performance.
