    NFTs Guard is a real MVP security platform that I built to explore risk
    detection in NFT markets. It connects blockchain data with an intuitive
    dashboard, helping users quickly identify suspicious patterns in wallets and
    collections.

    And actually no idea of the work tied to a site of this scale. From the
    pitch to the research to the wireframing to the design and the creation of
    interactions and animations, it was a long road. One that was fun and one I
    want to talk about in this case. Thoughts, ideas, and questions we tackled
    and solved.
