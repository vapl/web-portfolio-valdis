    "88 Barber shop" needed a modern website that reflects their brand: sharp,
    energetic, and unmistakably premium. I built a full multilingual platform
    (lv/en/ru) with dynamic content powered by Sanity CMS, custom animations,
    responsive layouts, and service pages that adapt to the client's evolving
    pricing and promotions.

    The barbershop had no structured content, no design system, and no CMS.
    Everything — from the service groups to the multilingual text blocks — had
    to be organized, mapped and made editable. The result needed to feel
    premium, load instantly, and work flawlessly on all devices.

<Section id="problem" title="Problem">
  - No CMS, no structure, no real content strategy - Services constantly
  changed, requiring manual edits - No mobile optimization - Branding looked
  cheap and inconsistent
  <PullQuote>
    The goal was simple: make 88 Barbershop feel as good online as it does when
    you walk through their door.

    I implemented a flexible CMS architecture for services, prices, barbers,
    galleries and multilingual content. All visuals, ribbons, and transitions
    use Framer Motion for silky-smooth interactions. Every piece of content is
    easily editable by the team without touching code.

  This project included a full custom UI/UX design in Figma, a multilingual
  Next.js frontend, structured CMS architecture in Sanity, responsive layouts,
  and custom animations powered by Framer Motion. The system allows the
  barbershop team to independently update services, prices, barbers, and
  multilingual content without touching code.
