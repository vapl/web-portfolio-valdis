# Web Portfolio – Valdis Vascenkovs

Personal web portfolio built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, focused on showcasing real-world projects through detailed, design-driven case studies.

The site emphasizes:

- clear product thinking
- technical decision-making
- performance-aware frontend architecture
- end-to-end ownership of projects

This is not a template-based portfolio. Every section and component is custom-built.

- **Content first**

  - Layout supports the story, not the other way around

- **Trade-offs over buzzwords**

  - Decisions are explained, not hidden
  - MVP constraints are treated as intentional choices

- **Animation with restraint**

  - Used to guide attention, not to show off

- **Scalable structure**
  - New projects can be added without touching core layout logic
